# Vehicle-Simulator

## Overview

- Main1_Driving_Data_Analysis.m:
	*  Process the driving data to obtain the maximum torque at wheel at different speed and the torque reserve at various speed and torque level.
	*  Study the correlation between the driver score and the torque reserve.

- Main2_Generate_Shift_Maps.m:
	*  Reconstruct the torque reserve from different driver score.
	*  Generate the shifting map using the torque reserve from different driver score.

- Main3_Simulation.m:
	*  Evaluate the accelerating performance of the shift maps from different driver score.
	*  Evaluate the impact of fuel economy and drivability metrics in the simulation using the speed profile an aggressive, medium, and relaxed driving cycle.
